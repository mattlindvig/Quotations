# Project Constitution

This document establishes the foundational principles and standards for the Quotations project. All code, features, and changes must align with these principles.

## 1. Code Quality Principles

### 1.1 Readability and Maintainability
- **Write self-documenting code**: Variable and function names must clearly express intent without requiring comments
- **Follow consistent naming conventions**: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/types, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- **Keep functions focused**: Each function should have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle)
- **Limit function complexity**: Functions should not exceed 50 lines; complex logic must be broken into smaller, composable functions
- **Avoid deep nesting**: Maximum nesting depth of 3 levels; use early returns and guard clauses

### 1.2 Code Organization
- **Modular architecture**: Code must be organized into logical modules with clear boundaries and minimal coupling
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Duplicate code must be refactored into reusable functions or components
- **Clear file structure**: Related functionality should be grouped together; file names must reflect their purpose
- **Dependency management**: Minimize dependencies; prefer standard library solutions when appropriate

### 1.3 Documentation
- **Public APIs must be documented**: All exported functions, classes, and modules require clear documentation
- **Complex logic requires comments**: Explain the "why" not the "what"; document non-obvious business logic
- **Maintain up-to-date README**: Keep project setup, usage, and contribution guidelines current
- **Document architectural decisions**: Significant design choices must be recorded with rationale

### 1.4 Error Handling
- **Fail fast and explicitly**: Errors must be caught early and provide clear, actionable messages
- **No silent failures**: All error conditions must be logged or surfaced appropriately
- **Type safety**: Leverage type systems to prevent errors at compile time
- **Graceful degradation**: System should maintain partial functionality when non-critical components fail

## 2. Testing Standards

### 2.1 Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum 80% code coverage**: All new features and bug fixes must maintain or improve coverage
- **100% coverage for critical paths**: Authentication, data persistence, financial transactions, security features
- **Test public interfaces**: All exported functions and classes require test coverage
- **Edge cases must be tested**: Boundary conditions, empty inputs, null values, error states

### 2.2 Test Quality
- **Tests must be independent**: No test should depend on the execution or state of another test
- **Tests must be deterministic**: No flaky tests; tests must produce consistent results
- **Clear test naming**: Test names should describe what is being tested and expected outcome
- **Follow AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert structure for all tests
- **Test behavior, not implementation**: Tests should validate outcomes, not internal mechanics

### 2.3 Test Types
- **Unit tests required**: All business logic must have isolated unit tests
- **Integration tests for APIs**: All API endpoints require integration tests
- **End-to-end tests for critical flows**: User authentication, data CRUD operations, key user journeys
- **Performance tests for bottlenecks**: Database queries, API response times, heavy computations

### 2.4 Test Automation
- **All tests must run in CI/CD**: Tests execute automatically on every commit
- **Pull requests require passing tests**: No merge without green build
- **Fast feedback loop**: Unit test suite must complete in under 2 minutes
- **Test data management**: Use factories or fixtures; no hard-coded test data

## 3. User Experience Consistency

### 3.1 Design System Adherence
- **Consistent visual language**: All UI components must follow established design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- **Component library usage**: Use shared component library; custom components require design review
- **Accessibility first**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required for all user-facing features
- **Responsive design**: All interfaces must work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop

### 3.2 Interaction Patterns
- **Predictable behavior**: Similar actions should have similar outcomes across the application
- **Clear feedback**: All user actions must provide immediate visual or textual feedback
- **Error messages must be helpful**: Explain what went wrong and how to fix it
- **Loading states**: Show progress indicators for operations taking >300ms

### 3.3 Content and Messaging
- **Consistent tone and voice**: Follow style guide for all user-facing text
- **Clear and concise labels**: Button and link text must clearly indicate action
- **Contextual help**: Provide tooltips or inline help for complex features
- **Internationalization ready**: Design for translation; avoid hard-coded strings

### 3.4 User Workflows
- **Minimize cognitive load**: Reduce steps required to complete common tasks
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show advanced features only when needed
- **Undo/redo capability**: Critical actions (delete, modify) must be reversible
- **Keyboard navigation**: All features accessible via keyboard shortcuts

## 4. Performance Requirements

### 4.1 Response Time Standards
- **Page load time**: Initial page load must complete in <2 seconds on 4G connection
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: <3 seconds for main user flows
- **API response time**: 95th percentile must be <500ms for read operations, <1s for write operations
- **Background jobs**: Long-running tasks must be asynchronous with progress tracking

### 4.2 Resource Optimization
- **Bundle size limits**: JavaScript bundles must not exceed 300KB (gzipped) per route
- **Image optimization**: All images must be compressed and served in modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- **Lazy loading**: Non-critical resources must be loaded on-demand
- **Database query optimization**: All queries must use appropriate indexes; N+1 queries prohibited

### 4.3 Scalability
- **Horizontal scaling support**: Application must support running multiple instances
- **Stateless design**: No server-side session state; use distributed cache when needed
- **Database connection pooling**: Efficient database connection management required
- **Rate limiting**: All public APIs must implement rate limiting

### 4.4 Monitoring and Metrics
- **Performance monitoring**: Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) in production
- **Error tracking**: All production errors must be captured and monitored
- **Performance budgets**: Set and enforce budgets for critical metrics
- **Regular performance audits**: Quarterly review of application performance

## 5. Security and Privacy

### 5.1 Security Requirements
- **Input validation**: All user input must be validated and sanitized
- **Authentication and authorization**: Proper access control on all protected resources
- **Dependency scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Secrets management**: No credentials or API keys in code; use environment variables

### 5.2 Data Privacy
- **Minimal data collection**: Only collect data necessary for functionality
- **Data retention policies**: Clear policies on how long data is stored
- **User consent**: Explicit consent for data collection and processing
- **Secure data transmission**: HTTPS for all connections; encrypt sensitive data at rest

## 6. Code Review and Quality Gates

### 6.1 Pull Request Requirements
- **Code review required**: All code must be reviewed by at least one team member
- **Automated checks must pass**: Linting, formatting, tests, build
- **No unresolved comments**: All review feedback must be addressed before merge
- **Linked to issue/ticket**: All PRs must reference related work item

### 6.2 Quality Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guide and passes linting
- [ ] Tests added/updated with adequate coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Performance impact considered and measured
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Security implications reviewed
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

## 7. Continuous Improvement

### 7.1 Technical Debt
- **Acknowledge and track**: Document technical debt with clear remediation plans
- **Regular refactoring**: Allocate time in each sprint for technical improvements
- **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code better than you found it

### 7.2 Learning and Growth
- **Share knowledge**: Document learnings and patterns in team wiki
- **Post-mortems**: Learn from incidents without blame
- **Experiment safely**: Use feature flags for experimental features
